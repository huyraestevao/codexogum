# Codex Ogum

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook used for sintering process calculations. The notebook `Ogum Sintering Complete 7.2 - June Calculations` collects all the code and widgets required to perform these analyses.

## Objective
The goal is to provide tools for computing and analyzing sintering parameters in Python. The notebook includes interactive widgets and scripts for processing experimental data.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have **Python 3.9** or newer installed.
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib ipywidgets
   ```
4. Launch a Jupyter environment of your choice. You can use a local installation (`jupyter notebook`) or open the notebook directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) by uploading it.

## Usage
Open `Ogum Sintering Complete 7.2 - June Calculations` in Jupyter or Colab and execute the cells in order. Follow the on-screen widgets to select activation energies and generate the plots and tables used in the project.

## Data
Input data files should be placed in the locations referenced by the notebook, or paths adjusted as needed before running the analysis.
